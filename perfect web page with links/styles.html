    <h1>What is style conference?</h1>
    <p1>TED Conferences LLC (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is an American media organization that posts talks online for free distribution under the slogan "ideas worth spreading". TED was conceived by Richard Saul Wurman in February 1984[5] as a conference; it has been held annually since 1990.[6] TED's early emphasis was on technology and design, consistent with its Silicon Valley origins. It has since broadened its perspective to include talks on many scientific, cultural, political, and academic topics.[7] It is owned and curated by Chris Anderson, a British-American businessman, through the Sapling Foundation.[1][8][9] 
The main TED conference is held annually in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada at the Vancouver Convention Centre. Prior to 2014, the conference was held in Long Beach, California, United States.[10] TED events are also held throughout North America and in Europe, Asia and Africa, offering live streaming of the talks. They address a wide range of topics within the research and practice of science and culture, often through storytelling.[11] The speakers are given a maximum of 18 minutes to present their ideas in the most innovative and engaging ways they can.[12] Past speakers include Bill Clinton, Sean M. Carroll, Elon Musk, Ray Dalio, CÃ©dric Villani, Stephen Hawking, Jane Goodall, Al Gore, Temple Grandin, Shahrukh Khan, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Billy Graham, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Bill Gates, Dolph Lundgren, Bob Weir, Shashi Tharoor, Bono, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Leana Wen, Pope Francis, and many Nobel Prize winners.[13]
